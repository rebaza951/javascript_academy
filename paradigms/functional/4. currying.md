## Currying

>It is the process where a function takes multiple arguments one at a time.

So rather than having a function that looks like this:

````javascript
fakeFunction('param1', 'param2', 'param3');
````

You end up with something like this:

````javascript
fakeFunction('param1')('param2')('param3')
````

## Why should care about currying

1. Currying gives the ability to compose concise and reusable functions.
2. We use functions as clean, testable units of logic to compose the more logically complex parts of out programs.
3. With currying any function that works on single elements can be converted into a function that works on arrays, simply by wrapping it with map.
4. Prevent side effects.

 Currying methodology allow us to chain arguments in a way that prenvents it from having any side effects.
   
...How?

- One argument:

> Your function does one thing and one thing only: It results in an output that can’t be disputed. The shape of your data doesn’t change. Mutability caused by side effects is reduced to zilch.

- More than one argument:

> When you have more than one argument, you’re setting yourself up for potential side effects.

A curried function can look something like this:

````javascript
function fakeFunction(param1){ 
   //do something 
   return (param2) => { 
     //do something   
     return (param3) => { 
        return finalResult;
        //The final function in the chain has access 
        // to all the arguments in the chain.
     }  
   }
}
````

## Practice example:

Let’s say you want to achieve the following process:

> check if stock exists.
> 
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--> check warehouse
> 
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--> deduct stock amount

Your curried function may look like this:

````javascript
function checkStock(stockID){ 
   //some check code 
   if(err){throw err;} 
 
   return (warehouseID) => { 
      //some check code 
      if(err){throw err;}
      
      return(stockDeduct)=> { 
        //some check code         
        if(err){throw err;}
         
        return stockID 
                + ' from ' + warehouseID
                + ' is reduced by ' + stockDeduct;      
      }
   }
}
````

So your invocation can look something like this:

````javascript
let orderItem298 = checkStock('FN9382')('SOUTH')(3);
````

**Note**: Yes, you could merge all three functions into one, but then how do you effectively detect issues every step of the
way?. Currying lets you do it in an elegant manner.

## Precursor

It is a checking method to make sure that you’ve got everything you need before you proceed.

It can be used as a precursor before your actual function. For example:

````javascript
function prepInvoiceLine(stockID){ 
   //some check code 
   if(err){throw err;} 
 
   return (warehouseID) => { 
      //some check code 
      if(err){throw err;}
      
      return(stockDeduct)=> { 
        //some check code         
        if(err){throw err;}
        
         return printInvoiceLine(stockID, warehouseID, stockDeduct); // Actual function
      }
   }
}

function printInvoiceLine(stockID, warehouseID, stockDeduct){ 
  return stockID 
    + ' from ' + warehouseID
    + ' is reduced by ' + stockDeduct;
}

let orderItem298 = prepInvoiceLine('FN9382')('SOUTH')(2);
````

## Partial Functions

A function that contains another and is responsible for storing a part of the code

❌ No currying

````javascript
const cuadrado = function (numero) {
  return Math.pow(numero, 2);
}

console.log(cuadrado(1)) // 1
console.log(cuadrado(2)) // 4
console.log(cuadrado(3)) // 9
````

✅ Using currying to simplify:

````javascript
const exponencial = function (potencia) {
  return function (base) {
    return Math.pow(base, potencia);
  }
}

const cuadrado = exponencial(2);

console.log(cuadrado(1)) // 1
console.log(cuadrado(2)) // 4
console.log(cuadrado(3)) // 9

const cubos = exponencial(3);

console.log(cuadrado(1)) // 1
console.log(cuadrado(2)) // 8
console.log(cuadrado(3)) // 27
````

Conclusion: we have used javascript currying to simplify our problems and add flexibility to functions

## Rambda and Lodash

We have functional JS helper libraries like Rambda and lodas, which provide us with utility methods such as curry.

The curry utility wraps normally declared functions and transforms them into a series of one-argument functions.

- we can convert this:

````javascript
const magicPhrase = magicWord => muggleWord => magicWord + muggleWord;
````

- into this:

````javascript
const _ = require('lodash');

const magicPhrase = _.curry((magicWord, muggleWord) => magicWord + muggleWord)
const muggleWordAccepter = magicPhrase('Abra kadabra');
muggleWordAccepter('dishwasher');
````
