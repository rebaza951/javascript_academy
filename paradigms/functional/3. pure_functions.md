## Predictability

In order for software to be reliable, it has to be **predictable**,
just like mathematics operations.

> In computer science, a nondeterministic algorithm is an algorithm that, even for the same input,
> can exhibit different behaviors on different runs, as opposed to a deterministic algorithm.

Deterministic Function

````javascript

function computeA(x) {
  return x * x;
}
console.log( 'result', computeA(2) );
console.log( 'result', computeA(2) );
console.log( 'result', computeA(2) );

// output:
// result 4
// result 4
// result 4
````

Nondeterministic Function

```javascript

function computeB(x) {
  return Math.random() < 0.9
    ? x * x
    : x;
}
console.log( 'result', computeB(2) );
console.log( 'result', computeB(2) );
console.log( 'result', computeB(2) );

// output:
// result 4
// result 4
// result 2 <=  not good
```

`computeA` function always produces the same output, given the same input, just like functions in mathematics.
In other words, the function is deterministic. Deterministic code is predictable code.

`computeB` function may produce the expected value, but this is not guaranteed.
Or in other words, the function is nondeterministic. Nondeterministic code is unpredictable code.


## Deterministic & Nondeterministic
Functional programming encourages the use of pure functions, which are 100% deterministic.

![alt text][deterministic]

Deterministic:
- Given the same input, always reproduces the same output.
- A function that doesn't depend on external state (its output depends only on its arguments).
- A function that only calls other deterministic functions is deterministic.

Nondeterministic:
- Given the same input, not always reproduces the same output.
- A function that calls another nondeterministic function (Math.ramdom()). Internally, it depends
  on system time (external state) to calculate the random value.
  It also takes no arguments — a dead giveaway of a function that depends on external state.

Deterministic example:
````javascript
const box = value => ({ value });

const two = box(2);
const twoPrime = box(2);

function add(a, b) {
  return a.value + b.value;
}

console.log("2 + 2' == " + add(two, twoPrime));
console.log("2 + 2' == " + add(two, twoPrime));
console.log("2 + 2' == " + add(two, twoPrime));

// output:
// 2 + 2' == 4
// 2 + 2' == 4
// 2 + 2' == 4
````

Update `add` function:

````javascript
function add(a, b) {
  a.value += b.value;
  return a.value;
}

console.log("2 + 2' == " + add(two, twoPrime));
console.log("2 + 2' == " + add(two, twoPrime));
console.log("2 + 2' == " + add(two, twoPrime));

// output:
// 2 + 2' == 4
// 2 + 2' == 6
// 2 + 2' == 8
````

Suddenly the result of the function is no longer predictable.

Why?

The function has caused a side effect by modifying a value outside its scope.
The function has modified its argument `a`.

## Pure Function

>The main characteristics are: DETERMINISTIC and NOT CAUSE SIDE EFFECTS

### 1. It is deterministic

> This means, that given the same input, the function will always return the same output.

✅ Good
````javascript
const add = (x, y) => x + y; // the output is solely dependent on the arguments it receives.
````

❌ Bad

- The function is dependent on a value which is external to its scope.
````javascript
const magicLetter = '*';
const createMagicPhrase = phrase => `${magicLetter}abra${phrase}`;
````
- When the function depends on a server (external service out of the function scope)

````javascript
const token = externalAPI.getToken(); 
// the function can't ensure that will always return the same value for the same input
````

### 2. Not cause side Effects:
> A side effect is any change in the system that is observable to the outside world

list of things that could cause side effect:
- changing the file system / logging the system 
- inserting a record into a database
- making an http call
- mutations
- printing to the screen / logging (console.log)
- obtaining user input
- querying the DOM
- accessing the system state

## Benefits of a pure function

- Readability: a pure function is easier to read, as it requires no context
- Testeability: Because pure functions are deterministic by nature, writing unit tests for them is a lot simpler.
- Parallel code: Since pure functions only depend on their input, and will not cause side effects, they are great for scenarios where parallel threads run and use shared memory.
- Modularity and Reusability: Because they only depend on the input you feed them, you can easily reuse functions between different parts of your codebase
- Referential Transparency: means that a function call could be replaced by its output value, without changing the overall behavior of our program. This is mostly useful as a framework of thought when creating pure functions.

## Embrace Immutable States
How do we make our code deterministic? By avoiding mutable state.

> Inmutable state is a very simple idea. Functions can only return new values and can never change the values were passed in.

For example, 
- `string.toUpperCase()` capitalizing a string will never change the original string. A new string will always be returned instead.
- The `addition` function, as in 2+2, can be thought of as `add(a, b)`. It doesn’t mutate the original numbers — it simply returns a new number that’s the sum of the values that were passed in.

❌ Bad!
````javascript
var rooms = ['h0', 'h1', 'h2'];
rooms[2] = 'h4';

console.log(rooms) // ['h0', 'h1', 'h4']
````
✅ Good!
````javascript
var channels = ['h0', 'h1', 'h2'];
var newChannels = channels.map(function (channel) {
  if(channel === 'h2') return 'h4'
  else return channel;
});

console.log(newChannels) // ['h0', 'h1', 'h4']
````

### Disadvantages of immutable state

You may have noticed that with immutable state, we create a brand new copy of some data structure on every single change. Imagine copying over an array of over 100,000 items over and over again — that must be slow, right? Isn’t this wasteful?

Yes, it is.

That’s why functional programming languages make use of a concept called persistent data structures. This simply means that whenever a change is being made, we don’t have to create a deep copy of the entire data structure.
Instead of creating a copy, persistent data structures simply reuse a reference to the older data structure, while adding in the desired changes.

![alt text][persistent1]

Unfortunately, mainstream programming languages typically don’t have built-in support for proper persistent data structures.
While solutions using libraries like **Redux and Immutable.js** are acceptable, it’s preferable to have proper state-management features (e.g., immutable data structures) built into the language.
