## Declarative Programming vs Imperative programming

### Imperative Programming:

> It is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state.

It is like you calling your friend to fix your car, telling how to do it step by step.

Problem:
the main problem of imperative programming is that instead of telling the computer WHAT we want it to do,
we are instructing it on HOW to do. 

i.e:

- go to the array at index i
- mutate or swap Disadvantages:
- code not readable
- it require our brain to analyze the inner working of the loop while keeping track of indexes, vars and more.
- increases the cognitive load when reading
- over time makes it easier to faulter in reasoning and logic

### Declarative Programming

> It is a programming paradigm that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.

i.e:

It is like asking your friend to fix your car. You don't care how to fix it, that's uo to her.


 - Don't iterate
   
Use higher-order function like "map, filter, reduce" instead of loop structure like "while, for"

❌ Bad!
````javascript

// triple the value of every element in a given array
const triple = (arr) => {
  let results = []
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
    results.push(arr[i] * 3)
  }
  return results
}

// sum all the elements in a given array
const sum = (arr) => {
  let result = 0
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
    result += arr[i]
  }
  return result
}
````
✅ Good!
````javascript
const triple = (arr) => arr.map((currentItem) => currentItem * 3)
const sum = (arr) => arr.reduce((prev, current) => prev + current, 0)
````

- Everything with functions

❌ Bad
`````javascript
var name = "carlos"
var greeting = "Hi, I'm"

console.log(name + greeting)
`````
✅ Good
`````javascript
// Good!
function greet(name) {
return "Hi, I'm " + name;
}

greet("carlos");
`````
