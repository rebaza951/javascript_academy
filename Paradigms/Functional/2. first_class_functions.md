## First-class Function

Mozilla's definition:
> A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions in that language
 _are treated like any other variable_. For example, in such a language, a function
> 1. can BE ASSIGNED as a value to a variable.
> 2. can BE PASSED AS AN ARGUMENT to other functions
> 3. can BE RETURNED by another function

Let's see some examples of how a first-class function works.

###### 1.1 Function as constant -> assigment

```javascript
const fn = (name) => console.log(`hello ${name}`);
fn('carlos');
```

###### 1.2 Function as value of key of an object -> assigment

```javascript
const obj = {fn}
obj.fn('carlos');
```

###### 1.3 Function as an array item -> assigment

```javascript
const arr = [fn]
arr[0]('carlos')
```

###### 2 & 3. Function as an argument & being returned

```javascript
const fn2 = (fn) => fn
fn2(fn)('carlos');
```

## Callback function

> The function that we pass as an argument to another function, is called a Callback function.

## Higher-order function

> A “higher-order function” is a function that accepts functions as parameters and/or returns a function.


```javascript
function makeAdjectifier(adjective){
  return function (string) {
    return adjective + " " + string;
  }
}


```
## Invoking functions:

###### 1. Using variable

````javascript
var coolifier = makeAdjectifier("cool");
coolifier('conference'); // cool conference
````

###### 2. Using double parentheses

```javascript
var coolifier = makeAdjectifier('cool')('conference');
```
