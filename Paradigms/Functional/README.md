## Functional Programming

Functional programming is a style of writing code that involves a pattern of 
  - passing functions as arguments 
  - the ability to return functions without causing side effects.
  - Immutability is one of functional programmingâ€™s best features.

The ability to pass and return functions is done through one of three concepts: 
  - pure functions
  - higher-order functions
  - currying.
