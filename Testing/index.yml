types of tests:
  - unit test:
      definition: "in the practice of testing small pieces of code, typically individual functions, alone and ISOLATED"
      contain:
        - which component is under test
        - what is the expected behavior
        - what was the actual result
        - what is the expected result
        - how is the behavior repoduced
      what is not: if your test uses some external resource, like the network or database, it's not a unit test.
      when to use: all the time
  - integration test:
      definition: "ensure that component collaborations work as expected. INTEGRATION TESTS ARE SIMILAR TO UNIT TESTS, but there's one big difference:
      tests are isolated from other components, integration tests are not."
      unit vs integration:
        unit: test for database access code WOULD NOT TALK to a real database.
        integration: test for database access code WOULD TALK to a real database.
  - smoke test: "A simple integration test where we just check that when the system under test is invoked, it return normally and does not blow up."
  - regression test: "A test that was written when a bug was fixed. it ensures that this specific bug will not occur again.
    It can also be a test made prior to changing an application to make sure the application provides the same outcome."
  - functional / end-to-end test:
      definition: "ensure that the app works as expected from the user's perspective. Assertions primarily test the user interface."
      happy paths: "ensure the critical app capabilities, such as user logins, signups, purchase work flows, and all the critical user workflows all behave as expected."

Test tools types:
  - test launchers:
      definition: are used to lanch you tests in the browser or Node.js
      code: "npm install karma --save-dev"
      examples:
        - karma
        - jasmine,
        - jest
        - testcafe
        - cypress
        - webdriverio
  - testing structure providers:
      definition: help you arrange/organize your tests in a readable and scalable way.
      code: "describe('calculator', function() {
               // describes a module with nested describe functions
              describe('add', function() {
              // specify the expected behavior
              it('should add 2 numbers', function() {
              //Use assertion functions to test the expected behavior
              ...
              })
              })
              })"
      examples:
        - mocha
        - jasmine
        - jest
        - cucumber
        - testcage
        - cypress
  - assertion functions:
      definition: are used to check if a test returns what you expect it returns and if it throws an exception
      code: "expect(foo).to.be.a('string')"
      examples:
        - chai
        - jasmine
        - jest
        - unexpected
        - testcafe
        - cypress
  - generate and display test progress and summary:
      example:
        - mocha
        - jasmine
        - jest
        - karma
        - testcafe
        - cypress
  - mocks, spies, and stubs:
      definition: to simulate tests scenarios, isolate the tested part of the software from other parts, and attach to processes to see they work as expected
      examples:
        - sinon
        - jasmine
        - enxyme
        - jest
        - testdouble
  - generate and compare snapshots:
      definition: to make sure changes to data structures from previous test runs are intended by the user's code changes
      exmpales:
        - jest
        - ava
  - generate code coverage:
      examples:
        - istanbul
        - jest
        - blanket
  - browser controllers:
      definition: simulate user actions for functional tests.
      examples:
        - nightwatch
        - nightmare
        - phantom
        - puppeteer
        - testcafe
        - cypress
  - visual regression tools:
      definition: are used to compare your site to its previous versions visually by using image comparison techniques.
      examples:
        - appllitools
        - percy
        - wraith
        - webdrivervss
