steps:
  setup:
    - run: npm init -y
    - run: npm install -D jest
    - run: npx jest --init
    - create an script in package.json, test:watch: jest --watchAll
    - create fizzbuzz.js and fizzbuzz.test.js
    - check everythins is working fine, create a test with true = true in the test file
    - run npm test
  work-flow:
    - create expected test for, should print 1 if they receive 1
    - implement logic for this test case
    - create expected test for, should print fizz if they receive multiple of 3
    - implement logic for this test case
    - create expected test for, should print bazz if they receive multiple of 3
    - implement logic for this test case
    - create expected test for, should print bazzbazz if they receive multiple of 3 and 5
    - implement logic for this test case
    - add implementation to print in console a loop of numbers using the function created
    - create expected test for, should print 0 if they receive 0
    - implement logic for this test case
    - refact the code to make it more readable
    - create a test to validate if the number receive is he typeof number
    - implement logic for this test case
